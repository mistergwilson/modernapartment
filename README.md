5-6 hours to complete project
I liked trying out the animation tool and also adding the city sounds.
The most challenging parts of the project were getting the lights baked correctly and figuring out how to get the globe rotating to be triggered by a click. I was getting a the black screen error that others mentioned in the forum.
